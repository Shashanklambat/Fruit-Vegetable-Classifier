# 📦 Fruit & Vegetable Image Classifier

A deep learning–based image classification project that identifies **fruits** and **vegetables** from images. This model can classify input images, run predictions on sample images, and even recognize fruits/vegetables using a **live camera feed**.


# 🧠 Project Overview

This project uses a trained neural network model (`classifier.h5`) to classify different fruits and vegetables.

You can:

- ✔ Test classification on sample images  
- ✔ Provide your own image and get predictions  
- ✔ Use your webcam for real-time fruit/vegetable recognition  
---



# 🚀 How to Run the Project

### **1\. Install Dependencies**

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.

Install required libraries:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**



### 2\. Run Image Classification on a File ###

**python image_check.py**

You will be prompted to enter the path of an image.Example input:

Enter image path: Images/apple.png

Output will show predicted fruit/vegetable name.



### 3\. Real-Time Classification with Webcam ###

**python live_camera_check.py**

A webcam window will open and predictions will appear in real time.
